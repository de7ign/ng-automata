# Automata

Automata playground is a web application for educational interaction with finite state machines and visualization of state machines algorithms.

## About

Automata playground aims to simulate the creation of finite state machines and interact with the FSM with various algorithms.

It's still in early stage, lot of basic and core functionality is still incomplete, basic UI/UX is complete although. It has some quirks and many parts are not yet available.

My future view of this project is :

- User can draw finite state machines and import and export in various formats (dot, json, svg, jpg, latex)
- User can use automata algorithms over the finite state model.
- This will help students to understand better through visualization and faculties can use this to avoid wasting time in drawing and going step-by-step explanation. The application will handle most of it.
